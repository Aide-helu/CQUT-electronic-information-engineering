@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT531 :"f:\fpga_project\baseboard\lab10_digtal_calender\encoder.v":74:1:74:4|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 2 sequential elements including u1.B_state.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"f:\fpga_project\baseboard\lab10_digtal_calender\encoder.v":32:0:32:5|Found inferred clock Digtal_Calender|clk which controls 121 sequential elements including u1.cnt[11:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
