@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"f:\fpga_project\baseboard\lab11_picture_display\lcd_rgb.v":60:0:60:5|Found inferred clock Picture_display|clk which controls 228 sequential elements including LCD_RGB_uut.state_back[0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
